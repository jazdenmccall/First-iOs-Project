First Project creating a I AM Rich App, objective is to learn how to create and set up new iOS projects.
We're going to, take an overview of Xcode and how it works. We're going to design our app using Xcode and Apple's pre-built iOS components and also incorporate some of our own image assets that we get either off the Internet or our own pictures and images into the app.
An finally, we're going to create a custom app icon to put onto our app and run it on a simulator and on a device.
